My main project is Extra Leaderboard, an Openplanet plugin for Trackmania, which accumulated approximatly 80k downloads! 

This plugin allow Trackmania players to have more informations on the online leaderboards of maps in Trackmania, by allowing them to see key positions as well as how many players got a certain medals on a map. It has thousands of users and is still actively maintained/updated.
